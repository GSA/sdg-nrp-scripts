Note that the International Poverty Line ($1.90/day at 2011 PPP) was equivalent to $730/year at 2014 prices,  roughly one-eighth of the US poverty line.  USAID came to this conclusion after reviewing the available, web-accessible Census surveys and consulting with Brookings Insitution poverty expert Laurence Chandy, who confirmed this interpretation.  Please note that it is possible that analysis of the underlying data housed at the Census site could provide an estimate of this number, but those calculations are not currently being made.  In the meantime, USAID recommends that the U.S. report that the number is approximately zero.

The Census surveys can tell us about the number and characteristics of individuals living below 50 percent of the US poverty line. However they do not offer much related to Sub-Goal 1.1.1. They do have a measure for the 'income deficit'  from the U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey, Annual Social and Economic Supplement. This basically gives the number of individuals below and size of the deficit related to the poverty line. However this does not provide the detail necessary to determine even for income (absent SNAP and EITC) how many people are below the $730/year threshold. For example, for individuals, the poverty threshold is around $12,071 per year. Therefore, we would need data that looks at those with an income deficit of $11,341 or more. And the data, as they are presented on the Census website do not go into such detail.

It is very unclear who would make that call, and on what basis. 
We suggest instead to go back to the basics, recognizing that the key to poverty reduction is economic growth (which accounts for 97% of cross-country differences in the rate of reduction in extreme poverty.)  In practice, a pro-growth"" development strategy IS a ""pro-poor"" strategy.  That being the case, we propose to use the ""Distance to the Frontier"" measure tracked by the World Bank's Doing Business unit.  This indicator captures the distance between actual country policies and best policy practice in the world, based on 10 different policy areas.  The indicator is strongly correlated with income per capita across a wide range of countries; it also has the advantage of being objectively measured, which most policy indicators are not.  The summary below provides more info:  
Distance to Frontier
The distance to frontier score aids in assessing the absolute level of regulatory performance and how it improves over time. This measure shows the distance of each economy to the Òfrontier,Ó which represents the best performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. This allows users both to see the gap between a particular economyÕs performance and the best performance at any point in time and to assess the absolute change in the economyÕs regulatory environment over time as measured by Doing Business. An economyÕs distance to frontier is reflected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the frontier. For example, a score of 75 in DB 2015 means an economy was 25 percentage points away from the frontier constructed from the best performances across all economies and across time. A score of 80 in DB 2016 would indicate the economy is improving. In this way the distance to frontier measure complements the annual ease of doing business ranking, which compares economies with one another at a point in time.

As agreed upon in Bangkok for all the other indicators pertaining to this goal, It would be premature to address this indicator in advance of the climate negotiations in Paris.  We know that we are asked to provide only minor modifications to indicators marked green at this time, but we believe that in this case, the indicator was meant to be marked gray (similar to its companions in Goal 13). Please advise.  CURRENT COMMENT: Interim from the Climate WG: Mobilized amount of USD per year towards the USD 100 billion commitment. [via CA 1/22: 13.a.1
-  The proposed indicator is:  Mobilized amount of USD per year starting in 2020 accountable towards the USD 100 billion commitment
-  No such commitment exists after 2025.
- Technically, it is impossible to measure progress against a commitment if no commitment exists.
- Hence, for the indicator to be technically valid, it must be time-bound, tracking the existence of the commitment Ð i.e., beginning in 2020 and ending in 2025.
- Ideally, we would have a supplementary, placeholder indicator for the period 2025-2030.

First, the exclusive focus on attempting to measure illicit financial flows (an ill-defined term) is misplaced, and while we agree that there should be further research on combatting illicit finance, we do not believe that a good, reliable metric can be devised in a useful period of time (the IMF, World Bank and others have been trying for years with no success).

As an example, trade statistics between the United States and Canada can differ by up to 20%, due entirely to differences in accounting and none of which is rooted in illicit activity.

Contrary to what UNODC claims, there is no established legal definition for small arms and light weapons.  The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) leaves the definition up to states (within certain parameters), while the Firearms Protocol understandably uses the term ""firearms"" and not ""small arms/light weapons.""  Additionally, the study to which UNODC references, known as the Global Firearms Study, suffers from poor methodology and will not provide the information sought by the current indicator, let alone one that is more effective.  We do not want this problematic study to become a permanent feature, which is what UNODC wants it to be.  UNODC will have a much stronger argument for making this study an ongoing project if Member States agree to use it as a measure of SDG 16.4 implementation.  It is also not clear that the U.S. could easily report on the current target given the broad range of law enforcement agencies in the United States and the lack of a centralized database for all seized weapons.  ATF's National Tracing Center is responsible for tracing, and can thus provide some data on tracing, but there would be no ""total firearms seized"" to compare it to.  We should also note that firearms can be (and are) traced even if they were not illegally trafficked (e.g. lost, legally acquired firearms recovered by police can also be traced).  Furthermore, a firearm seized in the United States does not necessarily mean said firearm was illegally trafficked.  It also doesn't necessarily mean the firearm was used in a crime even.  The United States has long opposed the use of the International Small Arms Control Standards (ISACS), to which the UNDP refer, as these are not best practices.  They go way beyond what any country does in some cases, and were drafted by well-intentioned individuals who did not always have experience in regulation of firearms.  States have not agreed on ISACS, and therefore we should not refer to them as the relevant standards mentioned in the current indicator.  Finally, it is not clear what other states would be able to report on this indicator given acknowledgement from the UN agencies that there's very poor national reporting on this.

Unlike ""illicit financial flows,"" there is an agreed definition and understanding of the term ""trade misinvoicing."" The IMF has used it for decades and has excellent data to measure this through the IMF's Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS) data set. Our analysis of DOTS data shows that, on a global basis, more than 75% ($730 billion in 2012) of measurable illicit flows are due to trade misinvoicing. So, while the indicator we've suggested won't measure every aspect of illicit flows, it will measure the largest component. Moreover, measuring trade misinvoicing has a direct connection to a country's ability to increase domestic resource mobilization given that, for every dollar of trade-related illicit flowsÑregardless if it is an inflow or an outflowÑtaxes and duties are not being paid to the government.
